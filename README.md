# Calculator
Calculator in iPhone style

This is a training project to demonstrate programming skills

Without using eval. Numbers can be entered either with mouse clicks or with the keyboard (ru-en). Functions for changing the sign and calculating percentages are implemented. The input window is filled to a maximum of 32 digits. Rounding numbers up to 10 zeros after the decimal point.

When entering from the keyboard:  
= and Enter are equivalent  
Ctrl + % => calculate percent  
Backspace => remove one digit at a time  
Delete => clear (analog of ac)  

Added functions for handling different errors. Such as dividing by zero, entering several commas and so on.
